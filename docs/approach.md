# Approach to Game-Theoretic Algorithms

This section outlines the approach taken to implement the game-theoretic algorithms, particularly focusing on the Minimax algorithm. The implementation includes two core components: the **Minimax algorithm** and **self-play** simulations, which can be used to evaluate strategies in two-player zero-sum games.

## 1. Problem Understanding

The problem at hand involves designing an AI agent capable of playing games that involve two players with opposing objectives. The AI must evaluate possible moves and select the optimal strategy based on the game's rules. The **Minimax algorithm** is used to calculate the best possible move by maximizing the player's chances of winning and minimizing the opponent's chances.

### Key Components:
- **Two-player zero-sum game**: One player’s gain is the other’s loss.
- **Strategic decision-making**: Both players are assumed to play optimally, seeking to maximize their own reward while minimizing the opponent’s.
- **Recursive exploration of the game tree**: The Minimax algorithm evaluates all possible moves and their outcomes.

## 2. Algorithm Design

### Minimax Algorithm
The heart of the approach is the **Minimax algorithm**. This algorithm works recursively by evaluating each potential game state in the game tree:
1. **Terminal node evaluation**: The algorithm first evaluates the terminal game states (win, loss, or draw) using an evaluation function.
2. **Recursion**: At each non-terminal node, the algorithm recursively explores all possible moves, alternating between the two players. The maximizing player tries to maximize their score, while the minimizing player tries to minimize it.
3. **Optimal move selection**: After evaluating all possible moves, the algorithm selects the move with the best payoff for the current player.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning (Optimization)
To optimize the Minimax algorithm, **Alpha-Beta Pruning** is employed. This technique eliminates the need to explore branches of the game tree that will not affect the final decision, thus reducing the number of evaluations and improving computational efficiency.

#### Key Concepts of Alpha-Beta Pruning:
- **Alpha**: The best value that the maximizing player can guarantee.
- **Beta**: The best value that the minimizing player can guarantee.
- If a node’s score is worse than the current alpha or beta value, it is pruned and not explored further.

This pruning helps cut down the search space significantly, allowing deeper searches within a given time limit.

## 3. Self-Play Simulation

The **Self-Play** component involves creating a simulated environment where two instances of the AI play against each other. This provides valuable insight into how the algorithm performs when both players are using the optimal strategy.

- **Game State**: The current state of the game is tracked throughout the self-play simulation. The game state is updated after each move by one of the players.
- **Alternating turns**: The game alternates between the two players. Player 1 is assumed to be the maximizing player, and Player 2 is the minimizing player.
- **End game detection**: The game ends when a terminal state (win, loss, or draw) is reached.

### The Self-Play Process:
1. Initialize the game state and Minimax algorithm.
2. Alternate turns between the two players.
3. At each turn, use the Minimax algorithm to select the best move.
4. Update the game state based on the chosen move.
5. Repeat until a terminal state is reached.

## 4. Evaluation Function

The **evaluation function** is crucial for assessing the desirability of a game state. The evaluation function assigns a score to a given state, which the Minimax algorithm uses to compare possible moves.

For example:
- In a simple 2x2 matrix game, the evaluation function may return positive values for states favorable to Player 1 and negative values for states favorable to Player 2.
- In more complex games, the evaluation function may incorporate board positions, piece values, or other domain-specific metrics.

## 5. Game-Specific Implementation

While the Minimax algorithm is general, each game requires a specific implementation of the game logic. For example:
- In Tic-Tac-Toe, the game board is represented as a 3x3 grid, and moves are evaluated based on winning lines.
- In Chess, the game state includes positions of all pieces, and the evaluation function must consider the value of pieces, board control, and possible checkmate scenarios.

The game-specific logic is abstracted into a **GameState** class, which is then used by the Minimax algorithm to generate possible moves and evaluate game states.

## 6. Performance Considerations

### Computational Complexity
The performance of the Minimax algorithm can degrade quickly with large game trees due to its exponential time complexity. However, the use of **alpha-beta pruning** can significantly improve performance by reducing the number of explored nodes.

### Iterative Deepening
To further optimize the search, **iterative deepening** can be used. This technique involves performing multiple searches with increasing depth limits, allowing the algorithm to return a result quickly while refining the search as more time is available.

## 7. Conclusion

This approach uses **game-theoretic algorithms** to model strategic decision-making in zero-sum games. By combining the Minimax algorithm with **self-play simulations**, we create a robust framework for simulating optimal gameplay in two-player games. With optimizations like **alpha-beta pruning** and **iterative deepening**, this approach ensures that the algorithm can perform efficiently even with limited computational resources.
